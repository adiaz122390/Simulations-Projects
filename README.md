# Simulations Projects
 A repository containing the projects completed for my Modeling and Simulations class.

The baccarat assignment required me to simulate 10000 games of baccarat to find the probabilities of different bets winning and the house edge.

The fastpass assignment required me to simulate Disney's Fastpass queue under different conditions. The queue assumed either a 50% utilization or 95% utilization. Under both of those conditions, I had to adjust the amount of fastpasses given out to customers to find an optimized level of fastpasses to distribute.
